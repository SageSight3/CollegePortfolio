Recently, a mysterious plannet, dubbed <b>Virtual</b>, has mysteriously appeared in the Aya star system, Avalon's parent star. You and your pack have been tasked with the first ever crewed mission there, and now wait on the launch pad in the cockpit of the Stardust I Aero, an SSTO (single stage to orbit) spaceplane ready to take you to the vessel you will call home for the next 3-5 years. The sun is out, and the eyes of avali everywhere are upon you. A new era has begun.",

Take off, and begin the multi-hour ascent to Avalon's upper atmosphere, in which you and your crewmates will circle the globe multiple times, before eventually switching from jet to rocket power to execute an orbital insertion burn and dock with the main vessel, fondly nicknamed the <i>Egg</i> by her engineers. Once docked, your sights will shift to Avalon's sister moon, Navari, and Ralla herself, for fuel harvesting and systems test before the long voyage to Virtual. However, a storm has rolled in from the coastline, and will intersect your launch trajectory. After being radioed by Stardust Mission Control (SMC) though, it's become clear, that if you don't launch now, it may be months, or even years before a window as good as this one returns. SMC has left the decision to you and your pack. What will you do?",

Feeling your bodies begin to press into your seats, the Aero's nose angles upwards allowing you a first glipse at the darker clouds of the coming storm. Then, only senconds later, you feel a small bounce, and the rumbling of the ground vanishes. Stardust I has offically begun.",

While the launch's flight path would likely lead to some perilous skies, to attempt to traverse them in the lowest part of the atmosphere could be a fool's errand. The wind in the jet streams at the top of the jet stream could be merciless, where the methane barrier that sealed in most of the moon's heat ended, and occassionally became dangerous as radiation from Aya and Ralla alike could cause it to act sporadiaclly. At best, to launch now would waste fuel and risk damage to the Aero. At worst, the engines could become clogged or pelted by hail, and you and your packmates would fall from the sky in a fiery wreck. The storm pelted the launch site for days on end, and when it was finally over, it was clear the Aero hadn't been left unscathed. Yet, as you begin examining the damage, you receive an excited radio transmission from SMC. The storm had ended early, leavng just barely enough time for Stardust I to make the launch window, on the condition you leave immediately. So far, dmage to the Aero, didn't seem too severe, the most notable blemish being a small dent in one of the engines. Leaving now though would forego closer inspection and potential repairs though. This could be a second chance, but is it worth the risk?",
