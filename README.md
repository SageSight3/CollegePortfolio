This portfolio contains a wide range of projects and code I've written and worked on over the full duration of my college carreer. There may be inconsistencies, or the absence of components in some projects tha may feel glaring, resulting from lessons and concepts I had yet to learn at the time they were written. 

However, these projects are a showcase of my journey from being completely foreign to programming to gaining deeper understand of the deeper and more complex concepts at play, and gaining competency in my programming capabilities, in design and implementation, best practices, etc.
