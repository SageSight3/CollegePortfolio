# Menu

**Forces:**
when you need a menu, but are trying to avoid excess code

**Resolution:**

The menu specification from the application framework will contain a list of items with similar parameters as a button. The reason for not jsut creating a list of button specifications, is so a menu can be built with its own UI desgn.
