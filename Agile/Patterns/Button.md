# Button

**Forces:**
if you need a button, but don't want code

**Resolution:**

in the application framework, the button specification will have a ```target``` and ```action selector```

Target = data in the model, button is looking at (see observer pattern)

Action selector = a message; a symbol that is the name of a method; the message to be sent when clicked 

Buttons are inputs only
