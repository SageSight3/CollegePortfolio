# List View

**Forces:**

if you are trying to avoid code, but need to create a list view

**Resolution:**

A list view specification in an application framework will know it's selected index, the collection of items its holding itself, and then any other components it needs to know about, like a menu, etc.

selected index = the index of the item in the list currently selected by the user

collection of items = the list, itself
