# Git - Commit

**Forces:** There should be a way to be able to easily know what changes to a project have been made, when they happened, and what versions are safest to use.

**Solution**

Commit changes made to your repo to your project through git.This can be done through use of the command:

```bash
git commit -m "message"
```

The -m and message are for adding a comment onto your commit that can be read later. Here, it's good to describe what changes to the repo you're committing, so that later on, it's easy to know what a specific version of a project is doing.

**Preceding Patterns**

[git_status](./git_status.md)

**Following Patterns**

[git_push](./git_push.md)
