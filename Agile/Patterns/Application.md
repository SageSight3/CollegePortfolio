# Application

**Forces:**
If there's a lot of code for opening an app, and it's identical, we don't want to duplicate that

**Resolution:**

Create a subclass of an application class, where the application class is a framework

on the class side, make a specification

**Following Patterns**
Specification
Layout
List Pane
Button
Text
Menu
